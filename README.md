# Deep-Learning-Assignments
Assignments related to Udacity Google Deep Learning course (started July 2017). These assignments are ipython notebooks written using Python 3.

## Assignment 1: notNMIST
This assignment uses sklearn to train and test a logistic regression classifier. The classifier is trained determine the letter (A-J) displayed in a variety of images from the notMNIST dataset. My code can be found in the following ipython notebook: [1_notmnist.ipynb](1_notmnist.ipynb)

## Assignment 2: SGD
This assignment implements gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent using TensorFlow. To improve classification accuracy, I implement a 1-hidden layer neural network with rectified linear units (ReLU) and 1024 hidden nodes. My code can be found in the following ipython notebook: [2_fullyconnected.ipynb](2_fullyconnected.ipynb)

## Assignment 3: Regularisation
To improve classification accuracy, I add L2 normalisation and dropout to the logistic and neural network models using TensorFlow. My code can be found in the following ipython notebook: [3_regularization.ipynb](3_regularization.ipynb)
